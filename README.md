# x11-desktop

Simple container with x11.

The general goal of this project is to enable a desktop environment to be launched as a container. Specifically to provide a desktop to open ondemand.

It is expected that this will be a base image from which other applications, such as Matlab, cryosparc etc can be built and ran for compute purposes.
